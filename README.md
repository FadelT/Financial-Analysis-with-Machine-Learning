# Financial-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning
Hello there, Welcome!
This is a project I've done during a course I followed on Udemy from Super Data Science: https://www.udemy.com/course/ml-and-python-in-finance-real-cases-and-practical-solutions/

The project consisted of three main parts:

The first one was about analysing stocks prices of some companies and trying to predict the futur trends.  

The Second consisted of making bank client segmentation for marketing. It was an unspuversived task since we had to make some clustering first. 

The third one was sentiment analysis of twitter comments relative to stocks. The goal was to identify through people's opinion on stock what will be the trend of those stock (high /down).
